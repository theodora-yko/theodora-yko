### Hi there 👋

My name is Theo Ko. 
I graduated from the University of Chicago with a B.S. in Computational and Applied Mathematics and a concurrent M.S. in Statistics in June 2024.
Now, I work as a Machine Learning Engineer at an InsurTech startup in Boston. 
In my free time, I love practicing yoga & going to concerts!
