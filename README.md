### Hey!

I'm Theodora, but my friend calls me Theo. I graduated from the University of Chicago with a concurrent M.S. in Statistics in June 2024 and a B.S. in Computational and Applied Mathematics. I have some really random hobbies (like walking the Camino!), but on top of everything, I also like learning new things and hope I stay that way. 

- Books I am reading in 2026: The Myth of Sisyphus, The Art of Loving, Educated, The Count of Monte Cristo 
- TV shows I've been loving in 2026: The Rookie, Blindspot
